# Agent Sharing Standard

The Agent Sharing Standard is a structured format for sharing customizable "Agents" or Personas designed for Large Language Models. This standard aims to streamline the process of exchanging and integrating agents across various platforms and applications.

## Features

- JSON-based schema for organizing agent data
- Versioning system for future updates and improvements
- Clear documentation and examples
- Community-driven development on GitHub
- Validation tools for checking agent file compliance

## Getting Started

1. **Understand the schema**: Familiarize yourself with the JSON schema that defines the structure and data types for each attribute in the agent file. This ensures that the required fields are present and that the data in the file is in the expected format.

2. **Create an agent file**: Using the schema as a guide, create a JSON file for your agent. Be sure to include all required fields and format the data according to the schema.

3. **Validate your agent file**: Use the provided validation tool to check your agent file's compliance with the schema. This ensures that your file is structured correctly and compatible with the standard.

4. **Share your agent**: Share your agent file with others by uploading it to the project's GitHub repository or by hosting it on your own server. Encourage others to use and contribute to the standard.
